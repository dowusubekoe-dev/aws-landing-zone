## 1. Incident Summary

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Date Detected** | July 6, 2026 |
| **Account Blocked** | Yes — outstanding balance blocked root password recovery on all member accounts |
| **Initial Estimated Charge** | ~$23.04 (June 2026 only — incomplete view) |
| **Actual Total Outstanding** | $223.31 across April–July 2026 |
| **Root Cause** | Team microservices project left EKS cluster, RDS, NAT Gateway, EC2, and supporting resources running across multiple months |
| **Primary Month** | May 2026 — $222.35 (EKS cluster alone: $153.65) |
| **Payment Made** | $23.04 paid on July 7, 2026 |
| **Remaining Balance** | ~$200.27 — AWS Support credit request filed |
| **Resolution Status** | Pending AWS Support credit approval (Case: 178336288500153) |
| **Account Status After Cleanup** | Clean — ~$0.64/month ongoing (CTF Lab EBS only) |

---

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
A shared team project deploying a **petclinic microservices application** on AWS left the following resources running continuously across April, May, and June 2026 without a shutdown plan:

| Resource | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **EKS Cluster** | $153.65 in May alone ($0.10/hr control plane + worker nodes) |
| **RDS Database** | $10.84 in April, $7.18 in May |
| **NAT Gateway** | ~$32/month when running continuously |
| **Application Load Balancer** | $7.95 in May |
| **Multiple EC2 instances** | Running across April–June |
| **Elastic IPs** | Idle IPs charged at $0.005/hr each |
| **EBS Volumes** | petclinic PVCs in us-east-2 (2x 10GB) |
| **EBS Snapshots** | AMI-backed snapshots in us-east-1 (2x 8GB) |
| **CloudWatch** | $4.91 in May from EKS logging |
| **ECR** | Container image storage |
| **Secrets Manager** | Team project secrets not cleaned up |
| **Route 53** | 3 hosted zones not deleted |

### Contributing Factors
- No billing alerts configured on the account
- No SCP blocking expensive services in Workloads OU
- No team agreement on resource cleanup after project completion
- AWS Free Tier limits not monitored
- Resources spread across multiple regions (us-east-1, us-east-2) making discovery harder
- AMI-backed snapshots not visible without `--owner-ids self` flag
- EKS charges not immediately obvious — control plane fee is separate from worker node EC2 costs

### Why the Initial Estimate Was Wrong
AWS Support's first response showed only ~$5.04 for July 1–6. This was a **partial view** of current period charges only. The full outstanding balance of $223.31 included unpaid charges from April, May, and June that had been accumulating.

## 3. Complete Billing Breakdown

### Monthly Breakdown by Service

| Service | Apr 2026 | May 2026 | Jun 2026 | Jul 2026 | **Total** |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Amazon EKS** | $0 | **$153.65** | $0 | $0 | **$153.65** |
| EC2 - Other (NAT GW/EBS/Transfer) | $12.50 | $21.70 | $4.94 | $0.84 | **$39.98** |
| Amazon EC2 Compute | $7.46 | $13.69 | $8.36 | $1.54 | **$31.05** |
| Amazon VPC (NAT GW + Elastic IPs) | $7.41 | $10.78 | $7.21 | $1.35 | **$26.75** |
| Amazon RDS | $10.84 | $7.18 | $0.08 | $0.01 | **$18.11** |

| **Monthly Total** | **$38.61** | **$222.35** | **$23.04** | **$5.47** | **~$289.47** |

> **Note:** $223.31 outstanding = total accumulated minus partial payments.
> $23.04 paid on July 7, 2026. Remaining: ~$200.27 (pending credit).

### Key Cost Driver — EKS in May 2026

EKS is the single largest charge at **$153.65 in one month**. Breakdown:
- EKS control plane: $0.10/hr × 744hrs = **$74.40**
- Worker node EC2 instances: included in EC2 Compute charges
- NAT Gateway for pod traffic: included in VPC charges
- CloudWatch Container Insights logging: $4.91
- Load Balancer for ingress: $7.95

## 4. Full Cleanup Actions Taken

### 4.1 Route 53 — Deleted All 3 Hosted Zones

**Issue encountered:** `HostedZoneNotEmpty` error — zones contained DNS records that had to be deleted first.

**Solution:** Delete all non-NS/SOA records before deleting the zone.

```bash
# List hosted zones
aws route53 list-hosted-zones \
  --query 'HostedZones[*].{ID:Id,Name:Name}' \
  --output table \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac

# Delete all non-NS/SOA records using Python
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(profile_name='cloud-eng-iac')
client = session.client('route53')

ZONE_ID = 'YOUR_ZONE_ID'

response = client.list_resource_record_sets(HostedZoneId=ZONE_ID)
records = response['ResourceRecordSets']
deletable = [r for r in records if r['Type'] not in ['NS', 'SOA']]

if deletable:
    changes = [{"Action": "DELETE", "ResourceRecordSet": r} for r in deletable]
    client.change_resource_record_sets(
        HostedZoneId=ZONE_ID,
        ChangeBatch={"Changes": changes}
    )
    print(f"Deleted {len(deletable)} records")
else:
    print("No deletable records — zone ready to delete")
PYEOF

# Delete the zone
aws route53 delete-hosted-zone \
  --id ZONE_ID \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac
```

**Result:** All 3 zones deleted. $1.50/month saved.

---

### 4.2 Secrets Manager — Deleted 2 Team Project Secrets

```bash
aws secretsmanager delete-secret \
  --secret-id arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:428101261622:secret:two-tier-app/db-credentials-ur44aw \
  --force-delete-without-recovery \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1

aws secretsmanager delete-secret \
  --secret-id arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:428101261622:secret:spc-stg-ue1-app-secret-01-8IWKce \
  --force-delete-without-recovery \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1
```

**Result:** Both secrets deleted. $0.40/month saved.

---

### 4.3 RDS Snapshot — Deleted Team Project Snapshot

```bash
aws rds delete-db-snapshot \
  --db-snapshot-identifier spc-staging-ue1-rds-db-snapshot \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1
```

**Result:** 30GB RDS snapshot deleted.

---

### 4.4 EBS Snapshots — Deregistered AMIs First (us-east-1)

**Issue encountered:** `InvalidSnapshot.InUse` error — snapshots were backing AMIs and could not be deleted directly.

**Root Cause:** Two AMIs created from EC2 instances during the team project still existed, locking the snapshots.

**Solution:** Deregister the AMIs first, then delete the snapshots.

```bash
# Step 1 — Deregister both AMIs
aws ec2 deregister-image \
  --image-id ami-018e64fb37b5491eb \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1

aws ec2 deregister-image \
  --image-id ami-0841b997ecad0ca7f \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1

# Step 2 — Delete the now-unlocked snapshots
aws ec2 delete-snapshot \
  --snapshot-id snap-0015676ffe66414da \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1

aws ec2 delete-snapshot \
  --snapshot-id snap-024146a79082603c5 \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1
```

**Result:** Both AMIs deregistered, both snapshots deleted.

---

### 4.5 EBS Volumes — Deleted petclinic PVCs (us-east-2)

**Discovery:** AWS Support identified an additional EBS volume in us-east-2 not
found in initial cleanup because the scan was limited to us-east-1.

**Lesson:** Always scan all regions, not just us-east-1.

```bash
aws ec2 delete-volume \
  --volume-id vol-0591e871c0e5d540d \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-2

aws ec2 delete-volume \
  --volume-id vol-084b7ad17dcb69a93 \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-2
```

**Result:** Both 10GB petclinic Kubernetes PVC volumes deleted.

---

### 4.6 EC2 — CTF Lab Retained (Intentional)

| Instance | ID | Decision |
|----------|----|----------|
| CTF Lab Instance | `i-080618a9f44bd9322` | ✅ Kept — active Linux training |

CTF Lab is stopped (not running) — only the attached 8GB EBS volume
incurs charges at ~$0.64/month.

---

### 4.7 Final Multi-Region Verification

```bash
# Scan all regions for remaining volumes
for region in us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-1 us-west-2 eu-west-1; do
  echo "=== $region ==="
  aws ec2 describe-volumes \
    --filters "Name=status,Values=available" \
    --profile cloud-eng-iac \
    --region $region \
    --query 'Volumes[*].{ID:VolumeId,Size:Size,State:State}' \
    --output table
done

# Scan all regions for snapshots
for region in us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-1 us-west-2 eu-west-1; do
  echo "=== $region ==="
  aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
    --owner-ids self \
    --profile cloud-eng-iac \
    --region $region \
    --query 'Snapshots[*].{ID:SnapshotId,Size:VolumeSize}' \
    --output table
done
```

**Result:** All blank — confirmed clean across all regions.

## 5. Troubleshooting Log

### Error 1 — AccessDeniedException on list-accounts

```
Error: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the
ListAccounts operation: You don't have permissions to access this resource.
```

**Cause:** CLI was using wrong profile or an IAM user without Organizations permissions.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify correct profile is being used
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile cloud-eng-iac
aws organizations list-accounts --profile cloud-eng-iac
```

---

### Error 2 — ConstraintViolationException on leave-organization

```
Error: ConstraintViolationException: The member account is missing one or
more prerequisites — MEMBER_ACCOUNT_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT_REQUIRED
```

**Cause:** Member accounts created via Organizations never had standalone
billing set up. AWS requires a payment method before allowing
`leave-organization`.

**Fix:** Skip `leave-organization` entirely. Use `close-account` directly
from the Management account — different API call, no payment method required.

```bash
aws organizations close-account \
  --account-id ACCOUNT_ID \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac
```

---

### Error 3 — Password Recovery Disabled on Member Accounts

```
Password recovery failed
Password recovery is disabled for your AWS account.
```

**Cause:** Outstanding bill caused AWS to block root password recovery
on all member accounts at the platform level.

**Fix:** Resolve the outstanding balance first. Use Switch Role
(`OrganizationAccountAccessRole`) to access member accounts without
root password in the meantime.

```
Console → Management Account → Switch Role
Account ID:    MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID
Role Name:     OrganizationAccountAccessRole
```

---

### Error 4 — HostedZoneNotEmpty on delete-hosted-zone

```
Error: HostedZoneNotEmpty: The specified hosted zone contains
non-required resource record sets and so cannot be deleted.
```

**Cause:** DNS records inside the zone must be deleted before the
zone itself can be removed. NS and SOA records are required and
cannot be deleted — all others must be removed first.

**Fix:** Use the Python script in Section 4.1 to delete all
deletable records, then delete the zone.

---

### Error 5 — InvalidSnapshot.InUse on delete-snapshot

```
Error: InvalidSnapshot.InUse: The snapshot snap-XXXXXXXXX is
currently in use by ami-XXXXXXXXX
```

**Cause:** Snapshots were created as part of AMI (machine image)
creation. The AMI holds a lock on the snapshot until the AMI
is deregistered.

**Fix:** Deregister the AMI first, then delete the snapshot.

```bash
aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-XXXXXXXXX --profile cloud-eng-iac --region us-east-1
aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-XXXXXXXXX --profile cloud-eng-iac --region us-east-1
```

---

### Error 6 — ValidationException on create-anomaly-subscription

```
Error: ValidationException: Immediate frequencies only support
SNSTopic subscriptions
```

**Cause:** `IMMEDIATE` frequency for Cost Anomaly Detection only
works with SNS topics, not direct email subscribers.

**Fix:** Use `DAILY` or `WEEKLY` for email subscriptions.

```bash
# Correct — use DAILY for email
"Frequency": "DAILY"

# Only valid with SNS ARN as subscriber
"Frequency": "IMMEDIATE"
```

---

### Error 7 — Unknown options on describe-db-snapshots

```
Error: Unknown options: --owner-type, self
```

**Cause:** `--owner-type` is not a valid flag for `describe-db-snapshots`.

**Fix:** Use `--snapshot-type manual` instead.

```bash
aws rds describe-db-snapshots \
  --snapshot-type manual \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1
```

---

### Error 8 — ValidationError on DeleteStackInstances (account-level)

```
Error: ValidationError: StackSets with SERVICE_MANAGED permission
model can only have OrganizationalUnit as target
```

**Cause:** Control Tower uses SERVICE_MANAGED StackSets which operate
at the OU level, not individual account level. Cannot target
specific accounts directly.

**Fix:** Target the OU ID instead of the account ID.

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack-instances \
  --stack-set-name AWSControlTowerExecutionRole \
  --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=ou-9skp-tbjk46xu \
  --regions us-east-1 \
  --no-retain-stacks \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1
```

---

### Error 9 — Control Tower AWSControlTowerExecution Role Failure

```
Error: AWS Control Tower cannot create the required role
AWSControlTowerExecution because some stack instances of the stack
set AWSControlTowerExecutionRole could not be deployed.
```

**Cause:** Suspended accounts in the Workloads OU caused CloudFormation
StackSet deployment to fail. Suspended accounts reject all
CloudFormation operations with `OptInRequired` (403).

**Fix:**
1. Identify failed stack instances
2. Delete stack instances targeting the affected OU
3. Ensure all active member accounts have accepted AWS terms
4. Retry Control Tower setup

```bash
# Identify failed instances
aws cloudformation list-stack-instances \
  --stack-set-name AWSControlTowerExecutionRole \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query 'Summaries[*].{Account:Account,Status:Status,Reason:StatusReason}' \
  --output table

# Delete failed instances by OU
aws cloudformation delete-stack-instances \
  --stack-set-name AWSControlTowerExecutionRole \
  --deployment-targets OrganizationalUnitIds=ou-9skp-tbjk46xu \
  --regions us-east-1 \
  --no-retain-stacks \
  --profile cloud-eng-iac \
  --region us-east-1
```

## 12. Key Lessons Learned

### Before Starting Any Project

```
[ ] Set a $10 billing alarm BEFORE creating any resources
[ ] Enable Cost Anomaly Detection
[ ] Define a resource cleanup plan with the team
[ ] Designate one person as resource owner responsible for teardown
[ ] Apply SCPs blocking EKS, RDS, NAT Gateway in non-production OUs
```

### Common AWS Cost Traps

| Service | Trap | Monthly Cost |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **EKS Cluster** | Control plane fee even with no workloads | $72/month |
| **NAT Gateway** | Runs 24/7 even with zero traffic | $32/month |
| **RDS Instance** | Stopped instances auto-restart after 7 days | $20–100/month |

### Multi-Region Gotcha
Resources can exist in **any region** — always scan beyond us-east-1.
The team project left petclinic PVC volumes in **us-east-2** that were
missed in the initial cleanup and only discovered via AWS Support review.

```bash
# Always run multi-region scan during cleanup
for region in us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-1 us-west-2 eu-west-1; do
  echo "=== Checking $region ==="
  aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" \
    --profile cloud-eng-iac --region $region \
    --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].{ID:InstanceId,Type:InstanceType}' \
    --output table
  aws ec2 describe-volumes \
    --filters "Name=status,Values=available" \
    --profile cloud-eng-iac --region $region \
    --query 'Volumes[*].{ID:VolumeId,Size:Size}' --output table
  aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
    --owner-ids self \
    --profile cloud-eng-iac --region $region \
    --query 'Snapshots[*].{ID:SnapshotId,Size:VolumeSize}' --output table
done
```
